# Build README

After a basic `build.sh` v1 script, here is the v2 `build.sh` script. It is now allowing you to build any java project with
the maven inspired file structure below. It is particularly adapted to very light machine : ARM architecture based ones a.k.a. RaspberryPi, OrangePi, BananaPi, etc ... or any simple projects.

It is using only `bash`, `javac`, `java`,`jar` and `git` command line instructions.
For this created executable `.run` file run... just be sure that a [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html "Go to the Java source and choose your favorite flavour from 8 to 15 !") is installed and a correct `JAVA_HOME` is set.

## Configuration

The first variables must be adapted to your needs:

- `PROGRAM_NAME` Your program name,
- `PROGRAM_TITLE` Your program name,
- `PROGRAM_VERSION` The version of your program,
- `MAINCLASS` canonical name of your JAR entry point class,
- `VENDOR_NAME` the vendor for this program,
- `AUTHOR_NAME` the author of this program.

The manifest is generated by the `build2.sh` script.

Then just do a

```bash
$> build a
```

And a few seconds later, you'll got some beatifull `$PROGRAM_NAME.run` and `$PROGRAM_NAME.jar` file in the `target` directory.

Execute the `.run` file to start your well packaged jar file in an autorun format.

## Some help on usage

To get some simple entry point, just do :

```bash
$> build.sh -h
build2 command line usage :
---------------------------
$> build [options]
where:
 - h|H|?|*     : display this simple help
 - a|A|all     : perform all following operations
 - c|C|compile : compile all sources project
 - j|J|jar     : build JAR with all resources
 - w|W|wrap    : Build and wrap jar as a shell script
